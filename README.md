Tracking of Tickets Codes

Tickets are tracked by google doc. Codes are merely obfuscated prize amounts. Tickets must be tied to ticketholders by this sheet.

A random available ticket code can be found by opening the 'Ticket Menu' and selecting 'Get Random Ticket'.
Once checked, a row will be considered unavailable and will be sorted to the bottom.

Ticket Generation

Ticket code must be entered into the text input, then submitted for the scratcher to be set. Prize is determined by ticket code itself, so it merely generates random loss prizes and splits the prize into whole number amounts by weighted random choice.
